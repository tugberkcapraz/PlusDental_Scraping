# PlusDental Web Scraping Project
This repository contains the code for my web scraping and topic modelling project

This project contains two main steps. 
> 1) Scraping the Trustpilot website to fetch user comments about the company named PlusDental.
> 2) After succesfully scraping the Trustpilot, using the acquired data for topic modeling purposes via LDA.

## ETL
 The ETL file contains:
 * Scraper.py
 * testing.py
 * Transform.py

 **Scraper.py** contains the code for web scraping. The other two are not of vital importance for this project

 ## Data
 Data folder contains the scraped data

 ## Notebook
 **lda.ipynb** is where I applied topic modelling.
