I finished my treatment and the results weren't as expected at all. Their specialists admitted that, and offered me further treatment.
I went to do a new scan and I received a new treatment plan via the app. The new treatment plan shows almost zero change!!
I told them I'm not happy with this and I'm not willing to pay over ‚Ç¨2000 for their fake promises. 
They are of course refusing my cancellation. I'm quite desperate at this point. I am now in touch with The European Consumer Centre and thinking to get a lawyer.

update: 2 months ago I asked the PlusDental to pause the payments for me. Their payments provider didn't reply at that point.
Now they contacted me to say I'm 2 months behind and they will start charging me commission. They are saying the payments can't be paused. PlusDental sent me a new treatment a month ago and I said I'm not happy with it. Since then I didn't hear back from them. I'm in a dispute with PlusDental, I tried to call them until my credit run out and nobody answered.

In the meantime, the monthly payments keep running and I'm so stressed. I got in touch with their payment provider to ask for a payment pause and they told me it's not possible, and to get in touch with PlusDental regarding the issues I have. Well... PlusDental isn't replying AT ALL. I'm just going in circles. 

Please bear in mind that this company seems to be the new way of scamming people. Do yourself a favour and stay away from PlusDental. They are friendly and fast in replying at the beginning, to attract new customers and make them buy their products but once you've made the purchase they'll ignore your request because they need to, of course, focus on the new comers. 

This is my story:
I ordered the treatment and it didn't succeed. They admitted that the results don't look as expected so they offered me a new treatment. 
They sent  me the new treatment overview through the app, so I can order it but I wasn't happy with it. The second treatment wasn't making any significant change and if I took it, my teeth will still not get the results I wanted, which is the ones I agreed to when purchasing the treatment. 

Basically, the treatment didn't work for me, I asked their payment provider to stop the payments until the dispute is resolved (but they said it's not possible), I told PlusDental that I want this purchase to be cancelled because I'm not paying ‚Ç¨2390 for a treatment that didn't get me the promised results.
There is no one to talk to, i just keep getting automated messages and emails.
I'm also getting automated reminders to order the new treatment. We'll, my dear PlusDental, I don't want to order the new treatment because the results don't look good on it!
I want to either get the promised results IN REALITY or my money back!

189,2021-10-18,Maria,"At first I was very much attracted by their value proposition, however later I realized that was more about how they advertised themselves. All my experience with the company has been rather unpleasant so far, with only one exception when I visited their branch and dealt with doctors. Let me give you some examples.

1. Back then in February, I ordered a dental imprint kit to be utilized at home. While placing the order, I read I was entitled to get a refund in case this kit would be damaged. Unfortunately, my imprints did arrive back at their premises damaged. Nevertheless, no one has informed me of the issue. As I don't speak German well enough to hold a complex conversation, my husband called them multiple times, however every time he was told various things, and only in May did it become known the imprint hadn't been processed. So I had been waiting for 2.5 months only to learn I should have started the whole thing from scratch again. The discount they gave me in return was equal to the one available online that time, thus there was literally little to no reimbursement for me. They also promised me I would get a refund for the damaged kit, as stated in their rules (see below what this actually resulted into)

2. It was in May when I had to choose the date of visiting their clinic, and such was available in mid-June only. The clinic itself turned out to be proper enough, and all the staff there were friendly and polite. However, then I had to wait for another month until my package arrived. Hence, the treatment itself started in mid-July. In case they had informed me of the damaged kit, I could have come to the clinic way earlier and started with actually wearing my aligners some months back.

3. Meanwhile, I had never received my refund for the damaged kit. I sent several emails to them, however they usually reply very slowly - perhaps they have an issue with English speaking personnel. I received different replies to my emails, however in the end I was granted my money back - this happened in September, i.e. half a year later.

4. Last but not least, their support is extremely unprofessional. As the treatment for my lower jaw lasts for a little longer than that for my upper jaw, I keep on changing my lower aligner, however still have to wear the very last available aligner for the upper jaw, in order to maintain the results. No one gave me clear instructions though on what I need to do until my retainers are delivered. On the other hand, I'm not satisfied with my upper jaw results, thus I contacted PlusDental via WhatsApp. They told me to send the respective photos by email, which I did, having informed them of this straight away afterwards. Not only did they never reply to my last WhatsApp message, but I also haven't received any reply to the email with photos for a week already. This level of customer service is unacceptable.

To conclude, the state of things seems to have been very unprofessional so far.",Very unprofessional. Not recommended.,1,DE,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/plusdental.de?languages=en&page=11&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3&stars=4&stars=5,en

Ten days ago, I left an ad-hoc inquiry about my treatment progress - I'm not fully satisfied with the results observed on my upper jaw as they are not equal to those proposed by the treatment plan. Guess what? I haven't received any feedback from them yet. They don't respond to my WhatsApp messages sent to their support either. 

After my previous review, they asked for my contact details and I left those, however with no effect. This begins to look like a scam.

191,2021-10-27,Josip ≈Ωivkoviƒá,"The saga that I had with these people would be a boring novella, suffices to say they're out for maximizing profit and they will do so at any cost, without any regard for the customer. I cannot stress enough how evil they are, and their horribly slow customer support DOES NOT help.

1) Do not, under any circumstance, accept their 'tooth reduction' treatment, where they shave off a side of the tooth to create more space for the aligners to work. Besides being a traumatic experience, I am left wondering how good this is for the teeth. And, the moment you are done with treatment, you will have a hole inbetween your teeth that will gather all the food you eat. 

2) The quality of the plastic they produce is bad. It will break and fall apart, and if you need to wear a set for two weeks, you WILL chew through them, causing a bunch of problems down the line. 

3) After I finished treatment, it took PlusDental OVER A MONTH to deliver retainers to me. Guess what happened during that month? Thats right, the retainer didn't fit anymore, and wearing the old aligners wasn't possible because they were destroyed (and they blamed me for that!!).
At this point, the whole treatment plan basically went down the drain. 

4) The retainers cost additional 100‚Ç¨ which PlusDental DID NOT refund to me given that they did not fit (i.e. it's useless). 

5) I moved countries during this time due to the pandemic, and their support was incredibly unresponsive throughout. Executing a secondary treatment was impossible due to pandemic-related logistics, and I simply did not want it because of the previous 4 points, i.e. I do not trust them. They offered 0 refund and threatened to sue if I did not complete payment. 

It's frankly unbeliveable, I never had a worse customer experience than PlusDental. I recommend any other alternative company, if for nothing, then for better quality plastic.","Thoroughly bad handling of teeth and inexcusable customer support, AVOID",1,BA,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/plusdental.de?languages=en&page=11&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3&stars=4&stars=5,en

As mentioned below, I'm not satisfied with my upper jaw results. It took PlusDental 17 days to react to my photos sent as proof for that, however I only received a standard message saying ""Your treatment progress runs as desired"" - hence, no real assessment of my case was made. This is horrible considering how much you pay them. You can be sure nobody cares what results you obtain through this treatment.

198,2021-11-03,Maria,"My level of disappointment increases pretty much every week. I have just received retainers from PlusDental. I haven't opened them yet as the upper jaw set is visibly dirty. I've sent an email to PlusDental with a picture as proof of my statement, however, it doesn't change much as I'm not going to wear something which is dirty from the very beginning. Even if this is about the production material remainder, I wouldn't like to have it on my jaw. Let me remind you one pair of retainers costs 99 eur, and for this price you receive a poor quality thing.

199,2021-11-04,Nikolay,"Plus Dental Copenhagen office !!! AVOID!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!

We have ordered PlusDental products (aligners) and received the package (delayed for 2 weeks) which appeared to be incomplete.

When trying to contact them to explain the situation in turned out that it is not that easy to get their attention as they do not pick up the phone. 

An initial impression was that the guys are busy and will call us back after listening a voice mail. 

We are keep on trying for two weeks now with no luck.

There is absolutely no way to get in contact with the local office! Neither by phone nor email.

In the the Head office in Germany they kind of want to help us and keep on promising that someone from International Customer Support Office will call us back. So far NOBODY did.  

Huge frustration and loss of confidence about Plus Dental in general and particularly about Copenhagen branch (looks like they are scammers) 

If we knew this before we would definitely stay away from it. We left with a useless incomplete package in hands, no support and unwillingness from Plus Dental side to return money.

211,2021-08-05,Ewa,"The first round of treatment didn't work (left me with an uneven bite) and I had to apply for the second one. It took several email exchanges to find out what will be done next. It was extremely difficult to get in touch with an actual professional and to receive an explanation of what the next steps will achieve. the whole ordeal lasted months. Now, after the second round I am in the same position- the treatment is still not done. I have submitted recent photographs and I am waiting already for 5 weeks for a reply! Customer service just keeps asking for more patience, but it is hard to remain patient if the incompetence of the company is adding several months to the treatment. Seems like they are happy to lure new customers, however, once something goes wrong they will leave you struggling to get any further attention.

216,2021-09-06,KKR,"Consult with your own dentist, better orthodentsit first..

For me, the result was not 100% perfect. Prior to the treatment, they request you to sign, that nothing prevents you from having alignments. 
Thus, it is your own responisibility to consult with your own dentist, whether you should have alignment or not.

I have crowns and multiple fillings. I wish I had consulted with my dentist before the treatment.

Since ever I had teeth straightened, I constantly have pain in my teeth here and there, it is all because my teeth had been treated before. Crowns, which had been fine, started paining after the treatment. Every day either one side hurts or another.

In my opinion, their treatment is ok for those who have majority of their teeth HEALTHY! If you, like I, have crowns, and multiple fillings, think twice before beginning the treatment. I doubt you will get your money back.
